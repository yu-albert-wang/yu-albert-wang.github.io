excerpt: 'This research investigates the impact of heavy metals on microbial community structure and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition in coastal sediments of Beibu Gulf, China. The study identifies chromium, zinc, cadmium, and lead as significant pollutants in the area. It finds that heavy metals alter the DOM composition, increasing the presence of recalcitrant organic matter, such as carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules and highly unsaturated compounds. The study also reveals that heavy metals negatively affect archaeal communities more than bacterial ones and shift microbial interactions with DOM. Various statistical analyses, including redundancy analysis and co-occurrence network construction, were used to explore these relationships.'
