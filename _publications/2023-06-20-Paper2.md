excerpt: 'The paper investigates the impact of ocean acidification (OA) on the microbial functional potential in the Arctic Ocean. Using high-throughput functional gene microarray technology (GeoChip 4), the study examines the functional gene structure and diversity of bacterioplankton under different pCO2 levels. The findings reveal that elevated pCO2 levels lead to higher evenness and stability in microbial functional genes, with more complex and stable molecular ecological networks. Additionally, there is an increase in the average abundance of genes involved in key metabolic processes such as carbon degradation, methane oxidation, nitrogen fixation, and sulfide reduction. These results suggest that OA significantly influences the metabolic potential of bacterioplankton, potentially altering biogeochemical cycling in the future.'
